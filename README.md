# Group-project
Overview
Warren Elsmore Ltd provide LEGO exhibitions and individual LEGO models for rental to our customers. We take bookings for up to 3 years in advance.

Internally, we use Airtable to maintain LEGO model data as well as bookings. We are looking to develop a web-based interface to this data, to visualise the data internally and to our customers. 

The interface will be used by our staff to plan time, in the form of a year planner, as well as identify sales opportunities. This interface would ideally be read/write. 
Externally, the interface would be surfaced in our website to show potential customers available booking slots.

Deliverables
Final list to be agreed, but the deliverables are expected to include;

- A web interface to Airtable, utilising Airtable's REST API.  
- a gantt chart styled output, scrolling endlessly forward in time.
- ability to zoom in to individual weeks, and out to years
- ability to define data to be pulled from Airtable through the interface (ie, nothing hard coded)
- Read and Read/Write abilities
- minimal browser requirements (maximum compatibility)

Note:
